# Music Releases

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
This project is a music-release app build using React. It was done in pairs using Spotify data to construct componments.
And we followed a specific design and reached our goals.

## The problem

We started off by thinking about the layout of the album and sketching the components that we would be using. Then we created components to make full use of what React has to offer, an make our components reusable. The app is responsive design so we started with the "mobile first"concept. 
We added features such as a collection of popular playlists, the play button shows and grows when the user hovers over it. The site is also divided into new albums and singles. And we dabbled in a bit of useState in React to make the playlists appear in mobile view.
